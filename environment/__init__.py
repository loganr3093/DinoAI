# environment/__init__.py

"""
This file makes the 'environment' directory a Python package.
It allows for organized imports of environment-related modules,
such as the custom DinoEnv class that interfaces with the Chrome Dinosaur Game.
This module ensures that all environment code is encapsulated and can be easily integrated with the agent.
